Some naming conventions:

- ``xxx_fp``: The real file path (not equal to the absolute path) 
that can be used to directly access the file.
- ``xxx_fname``: The file name.
- ``xxx_namespace``: A directory that contains files.
- ``address``: Same to ``xxx_namespace``, but it is specially used 
for the main server namespace.
